# ziHF2_ch2_harmonic2
A parametric sweep set up for testing the phase error of the Zurich Instruments HF2LI Lock-in Amplifier for a scientific experiment.
Therefore, I generate (function generator: rigol dg1022) two sinusoidal signals at different frequencies but f2 is always doubled f1. 
The other parameter is the phase between this 2 signals. After measuring interesting parameters from the lock in 
(frequency, absolute value und phase of the first signal and of the 2nd hormonic of the 2nd signal) the absolute and relative error
is calculated and then stored in excel files and in one HDF file.
